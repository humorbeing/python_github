### Check List
- [ ] level one is divided into different computers.
    - for git update
    - `/project/computerA`
- [ ] level two is runnable code versions.
    - for visit anytime
    - same for colab
    - `/project/computerA/code_v0001`
- [ ] **`args`** as controlling parameter of the project
- [ ] **`args`** logs into csv list when run
- [ ] print this **`args`** when run
- [ ] when logging, need a save name naming policy from **`args`**
    - model save name
    - log save name
- [ ] modularize project
    - [ ] **`args`**
    - [ ] runner(**`args`**)
    - [ ] log utility
        - naming policy
    - [ ] utility
    - [ ] models
- [ ] **`args`** parameter naming policy
    - args.log_path
    - args.model_save_path
    - args.data_path
- [ ] log has `all_logs`, `received_logs`, `saved_logs`, `sent_logs`
    - `all_logs`, `received_logs`, `saved_logs` is in main log folder
    - `sent_logs` is in sub log file (other computers, colab)
        1. logA is sent by computer A and moved into `sent_logs` in computer A
        1. logA is in `received_logs`
        1. logA is merged into `all_logs`
        1. logA is moved into `saved_logs`
- Example of folders

            - `/code_v0002`
                - `/logs`
                - `/sent_logs`
            - `/gather_logs_here`
                - `/all_logs`
                - `/received_logs`
                - `/saved_logs`
            - `/old_code`
                - `/old_code_from_A`
                    - `/logs`
                    - `/sent_logs`
    - Computer A:
