# delete_all_but.py
- delete all files but ```*.py```, ```*.md```, ```*.ipynd```.
Basicly cleans up entire folder.
    - It is cleaning everything in ```MASTERPIECE``` folder. No need to go into newly added folders.
- Might run into problems, if the *targeted* folder is **git**-ed. Use ```rm -Rf .git .gitignore``` commend to **un-git** the folder.
