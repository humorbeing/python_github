- learning decay and manual update of the weight
    - companied with if not improving judgment
- getattr is used to define models
- entire training has one-hot bases, but never used one.
    - input is indexes
        - embedding to vectors
    - output is raw logit
        - used a integrated loss, which takes in logits and indexes
    - target is indexes
