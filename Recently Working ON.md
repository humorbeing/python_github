1. 4 experiments
1. code awesomisation
1. RNN experiment episode max limit problem
1. VAE pre-train, then use rnn policy
1. encoder pre-train, then use rnn policy
1. collecting results, making log
    - when running on other computer, make log's name more local. E.g., `n202_log.txt`
1. making PLOT
    - using 40 average to show trend.
1. untrained encoder
1. extreme rnn
1. Simplify game domain
1. awesomisation
1. different seed
1. argmax when testing
